# CSCI3090U Final Project - Drive A Car

This is a base OpenGL Project with makefiles for UNIX (supporting Linux and the Windows Subsystem for Linux), MacOS, and Windows (via NMake or MGW).

# How to Build

## Windows
Open a 'Visual Studio Developer Command' and navigate to the directory, then run 'nmake /F Nmakefile.Windows'
Or: Open the visual studio solution and build the release (or debug) version.


# To Run
Double click the compiled Executable

Note: For some reason, running the executable from inside the command line causes it to start thinking W was held down. Just double click the executable to avoid this.

I removed the pedestal, aligned it to axis, and added some extra 'object' groups.
